# Car Price Prediction

## What is car price prediction?
##### Deciding whether a used car is worth the posted price when you see listings online can be difficult. Several factors, including mileage, make, model, year, etc. can influence the actual worth of a car. From the perspective of a seller, it is also a dilemma to price a used car appropriately. Based on existing data, the aim is to use machine learning algorithms to develop models for predicting used car prices.

# Random Forest Regression
##### Random Forest is an ensemble technique capable of performing both regression and classification tasks with the use of multiple decision trees and a technique called Bootstrap and Aggregation, commonly known as bagging.
